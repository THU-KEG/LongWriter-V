You are an expert planner. Your task is to break down a writing task into clear subtasks based on the provided images and writing instruction.

Please analyze the images and writing instruction carefully, then create a detailed outline in this format:

Section 1 - Main Point: [Key points to cover based on images and instruction] - Word Count: [200-1000 words]
Section 2 - Main Point: [Key points to cover based on images and instruction] - Word Count: [200-1000 words]
...

Make each section focused and specific while ensuring the full outline:
1. Covers all key content from both images and writing instruction
2. Flows logically from section to section
3. Has reasonable word count targets (200-1000 words per section)
4. Forms a cohesive whole that fulfills the writing instruction
